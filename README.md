# Thesis writing resources
In this repo I am sharing the resources I find useful.
My thesis is being written in latex using mainly overleaf (with some local copies when needed) and to ease the mental process of searching the useful tips online to remove the hustle of serching for resources while focusing to the main writing task.
This resource list is a living document guiding me through. 

## Compiled list of  resources for thesis writing 
### 0. Ideeas 
* Using a project tracking tool writing down daily goals and checking them regularly seems like the most common and working strategy. 
* Creating a private repo at Github and working there as a project would be my way of completing my thesis.
* My local writing tools are miktex compiler local copy and overleaf, syncing through github. 
* Projects section has kanban board and I know it is useful.

### 6. Templates
Some instituons have templates to ease the process of thesis writing. There might be also strict guidelines for accepted referencing formats. 
I find it useful to have such resources available.
